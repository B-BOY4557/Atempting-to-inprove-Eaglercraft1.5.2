# a fork of eaglercraft designed for use of hapara students

if you use hapara at school this makes it look like your useing hapara

i'm woking on this in my own time so its a on and off project, as ik schools commonly use hapara or google classroom my plan is to make it so this fork
or eaglercraft 1.5.2 will work. in my experience hapara highlights if your on the tab of this game will show a blank screen with nothing exept the hapara logo 
and the word highlights teacher side, student side you get the game running aswell as your cpu and web gl 2.0 can run it.

bare with me here as my plan is to finish this by the end of the month ang get it up on my site for web use and maybe make a mac, windows and linux client to run from 
your desktop vis a html chromeium thing sorta like the snapchat and discord desktop client... if i can figure out how to do that, gamemaker or unity might have it built in lol.

enjoy the bace build while its here but soon it will be completed :3
